This is a prototype 'card reader' program intended for use in an access system for
opening doors with NFC. 


Requirements:
- a NFC reader that works with libnfc
- a MiFare Classic 1K card. 
- libnfc and libfreefare
- libcurl 
- the accompanying 'backend/server' program

Edit Makefile with the correct paths to the libnfc, libfreefare and libusb (if
used by your reader). In the future I will move this to CMake.

There are hooks in action.c for actions that take place when a valid or
invalid card is presented. For now, this just involves sending either 
'v' (valid) or 'i' (invalid) over the serial port, i.e to an Arduino
that blinks a LED. 
The intention is to have a modular interface so different ways of 
triggering a door-latch mechanism can be used.
